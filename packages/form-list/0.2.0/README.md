# Form list
## A package for outputting an expansion via one form, using a list in a CSV file.

# Setup
The `package.yml` does not need to be edited.

You will need to edit the entries in the `form_urls.csv`. The sample lines are a good starting point. The basic syntax is:

| Name/description (without quotes) | URL |
| --- | --- |
| gmail | https://gmail.com/ |

**Separate the fields with a comma.** Remember to save the file.

## reuse

You can of course also copy the contents of this package and create multiple form lists with other text. If you do so, you will need to edit the global variable for the location of the csv file.

**Requires Python.**
